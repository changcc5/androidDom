THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL KXML PARSER

4 lines have been commented out!!!

        // YURA srcPos = 0;
        // YURA srcCount = 0;
        // YURA peekCount = 0;
        // YURA depth = 0;

in the method:

    public void setInput(Reader reader) throws XmlPullParserException {

this is to allow the parser to carry on where it left off on a stream
this is used in the Agent Project for streaming XML
